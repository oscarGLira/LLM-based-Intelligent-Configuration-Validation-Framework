Ignore basic configurations, assume interfaces and routing is already configured correctly, is not required create a communication channel, remote or console to the device so assume you are in the interface global configuration level to configure each device. Use {topology_status} to obtain relevant information usefull for each configuration required, extract this information and specified it in each step .<\s>
